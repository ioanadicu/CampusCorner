# Campus Corner

Campus Corner is a gamified productivity web app designed to help students manage their tasks in an immersive 3D environment. Developed as a collaborative project, it features a secure Flask backend integrated with PostgreSQL, iCalendar sync, and University of Manchester login authentication.

The frontend uses Three.js to render an interactive 3D room designed in Blender, enhancing user engagement with an accessible and multilingual interface built on React and Tailwind CSS. Ethical design principles such as data minimization and encryption are applied throughout.
